# Lab 2 solution


index.html has buttons to trigger the solidity functions

gitlab.com is a mock version of gitlab to create the issues and merge requests to act upon in index.html

features:
creation of issues and merge requests work
list issues and merge requests
funding of issues

issues:
lists of issues are not shared across contracts, so voting and withdrawal does not exist

n-out-of-m validation, auto merge and withdrawal implementd, but not tested due to issue.
