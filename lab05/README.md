Task1 gets the head of a list in several different ways

Task2 uses foldl to calculate the factorial of a list

Task3 gets the n-th fibbonachi nmber

Task4 is a much more optimized way of getting the fibbonachi numbers, using tail recursion to calculate it.

megafibb.txt is the one millionth fibbonachi number. I wanted to see how high and how effective it would be at calculating _really_ big numbers, and i was surprised at how fast it went
