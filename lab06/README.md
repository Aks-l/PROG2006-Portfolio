# lab6

The lab takes a sequence of numbers, and uses various functions to find _the hidden message_.
It has several checks on the way to make sure the message is valid, and uses the bind operator to result in Nothing if it is invalid.
To try it, enter a sequence of numbers as a string as `msg` in Main.hs line 7. For example "5 5 5 8 1 2 3 4 9 8 2 3 4 8" should return "Just 3"
